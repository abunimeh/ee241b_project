To use this repo:

Prereqs:
1. Python 2.6+
2. Run 'pip install --user bitarray'

1. Source the 'sourceme'
2. ./runme.sh c17 100 10
    - This will ask the runme.sh script to create 100 test sequences for the c17 circuit inside the iscas85_verilog folder that consist of 10 test vectors each. 
    - The test vectors are stored in a created folder called input_test_vectors.
    - The script will then automatically generate a testbench for c17
    - Then VCS will be run and the output vectors for the input vectors are captured in the input_test_vectors folder.
    - c17 can be replaced with any circuit
